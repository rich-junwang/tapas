The case was widely covered in US media, who called the initially unidentified boy \"Baby Lollipops\", after the design on the T-shirt he was wearing when found.\nCardona was arrested for the murder and sentenced to death; her girlfriend, Olivia Gonzalez, was sentenced to forty years. On a second appeal Cardona was sentenced to life in prison. Gonzalez was released after 14 years." } questions { id: "SEGMENT_TITLE" original_text: "Background" } questions { id: "SEGMENT_TEXT" original_text: "Lazaro Figueroa was born on September 18, 1987 to Ana Maria Cardona and Fidel Figueroa. Cardona also had two older children. Fidel Figueroa was a well-known drug dealer and died under mysterious circumstances on September 20, 1987. This crime remains unsolved.\nIn November 1990, Lazaro Figueroa\'s body was discovered in front of a beach property in Miami Beach. He had been severely battered, which made it initially very difficult for authorities to identify him. Because Lazaro\'s remains were unidentified for weeks after his discovery, local news outlets nicknamed him \"Baby Lollipops\" in reference to the shirt he was found wearing.  The cause of death was later determined to be a blow to the head from a baseball bat. Trial evidence showed that shortly after leaving Lazaro\'s body in the bushes, the couple fled to Central Florida, even making a stop at Disney World.\nDespite claims by neighbors and other individuals that Cardona was abusive towards Lazaro, she consistently denied it. Her main defense was that it was Olivia Gonzalez, her lover, who had beaten Lazaro and delivered the fatal blow with a baseball bat. Cardona attested that she wanted to escape the pain of her son\'s horrible beatings at her girlfriend\'s hands and so sank into cocaine use to cope. To support claims on the influence of her past in the case, her defense presented the court with evidence pertaining to her unsettled Cuban upbringing and the psychological devastation caused by the death of Lazaro\'s father. According to prosecutor Reid Rubin, however, Cardona was \"angry and spiteful\" from the death of her wealthy husband as she had lost a luxurious lifestyle.\nGonzalez, however, was able to state her case against Cardona in exchange for a lighter 40-year sentence on the count of second-degree murder. She served 14 years. While admitting she played a role in her girlfriend\'s abuse of Lazaro, she was able to lay the majority of the blame on Cardona for Lazaro\'s eventual death." }

The filmmaker\'s commentary asserts a criticism of the way wavy hair, lighter skin and a slender nose are still considered more attractive in the black community in light of historical and contemporary movements which have sought to liberate black self-esteem. As a practicing and teaching sociologist, the filmmaker sought to illuminate the notion of symbolic violence through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu and spark conversation not just in the black community but all other communities as well.
